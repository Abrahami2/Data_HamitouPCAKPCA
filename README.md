README: PCA and KPCA Implementation and Analysis
Hello! In this project, I've explored dimensionality reduction techniques using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) on two datasets: TrainData and TestData. Below, I've detailed the steps I undertook and my findings.

Datasets:
I utilized two datasets for this project: TrainData and TestData. 

Part 1: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
1.1 PCA Implementation from Scratch:
a. I've written a custom Python code to implement PCA without relying on third-party libraries.

b. My PCA implementation was applied to the TrainData dataset to reduce its dimensionality.

c. To retain a significant amount of variance in the dataset, I carefully selected an appropriate number of principal components.

1.2 PCA using scikit-learn:
a. I imported the PCA module from the popular machine learning library, sklearn.

b. Using this module, I then applied PCA to the TrainData dataset.

Part 2: Kernel PCA (KPCA)
2.1 KPCA with RBF Kernel:
a. I implemented the Kernel PCA using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel from scratch.

b. Subsequently, this KPCA implementation was applied to the TrainData dataset.

2.2 KPCA with Polynomial Kernel:
a. I delved further into KPCA by creating a version that uses the Polynomial kernel, again crafted from scratch.

b. This version was also applied to the TrainData dataset.

2.3 KPCA with Linear Kernel:
a. Lastly, I implemented KPCA with a Linear kernel from scratch.

b. And, like the previous implementations, I applied it to the TrainData dataset.

Part 3: Testing and Evaluation
3.1 Applying PCA and KPCA to the Test Dataset:
a. I used the trained PCA and KPCA models (both RBF and Polynomial) from the training phase to transform the TestDataset.

b. To ensure consistency, I made certain that the dimensionality reduction performed on the test data matched the training data.

3.2 Classification Experiment:
a. For classification purposes, I utilized a minimum distance classifier on the TestDataset.

b. I assessed the classification performance using accuracy metrics to determine the effectiveness of my models.

Conclusion:
I summarized my results, highlighting the potency of PCA and KPCA in reducing dimensionality. Moreover, I reflected on their impact on classification performance. I also discussed the pros and cons of creating these algorithms from scratch in comparison to employing scikit-learn's pre-built functions.
